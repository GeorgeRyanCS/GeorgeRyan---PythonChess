# GeorgeRyan---PythonChess
A simple chess game made in Python!

To play, open the project in codespaces and type "python main.py"
The code displays a simple chess board, with the pieces repersented by letters (eg: P for pawn, Q for Queen)
The code runs on UCI chess notation find a guide here: https://publish.obsidian.md/modern-uci-doc/UCI+Docs/Miscellaneous/Move+Notation

For Furture interations I intend to code a better engine into the backend, as for now the AI opponent makes random moves.
